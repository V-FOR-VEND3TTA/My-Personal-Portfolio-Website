          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <!--
          <h4>Front end web development</h4>-->
          <img src="dist/img/coder.jpg">
          <p>
            Proficient in HTML, CSS (with Sass), JavaScript (with Vue) and
            Bootstrap. I also have this new thing going for GraphQL which I use
            when working with React. I also know how to use other tools like
            JSON, AJAX and XML.
          </p>
          <h4>Backend web development</h4>
          <p>
            Django has been my main go to when it comes to backend because of
            its ease of use and rapid development, I also use PHP frequently (I
            don't like it but it does the job). Node.js is another tool I use
            but because of the projects I have been doing it has been less
            favoured (Vue.js and Node.js project loading though ). My stack also
            consists of MySQL, and MongoDB and I also use and build REST APIs

          <h3>Web Design</h3>
          <p>
            I have been using Figma, Photoshop, and Illustrator for over 2 years
            now.<br />
            I use Figma for wireframing and prototyping evrytime I start a big
            project that I want to visualize.<br />
            It helps me pay atttention to the details and work using the
            constraints, instead of doing unplanned work.<br />
            I use Photoshop for designing websites and image conversion (when I
            design a website and I want images with transparent background,
            although lately I have been going back to old pen and paper and
            designing in the browser) and Adobe Illustrator for exploring
            creative ideas when I feel like drawing or coming up with a new
            concept for an application.

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>
            My journey started off with C++ (Hell, I know.) Although nowadays I
            recall bits of it as what you don't use, you lose. It was 10 or 11
            years later until I got back to programming... mere months after
            finishing high school in my gap year (This is my 3rd gap year).<br />
            When I got back to programming, the language I learnt first was
            Python. I chose it for many reasons (number one being ease of use as
            I didn't want to complicate my life like I did with C++, number two
            being multiparadigm). It opened many doors and helped boost my
            confidence.<br />
            C++ didn't dull my courage though, it forced me to learn the
            fundamentals of programming and Computer Science anew.<br />
            As a result I now take a more principled approach to coding through
            having learnt data structures and algorithms.
