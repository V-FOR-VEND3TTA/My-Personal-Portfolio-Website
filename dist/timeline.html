            Continuation of the CapaCiTi internship... I was deployed to a
            CapaCiTi partner that gave us a 6 month work experience. I worked as
            a Django backend developer who dabbled in PHP per the requirements
            of the software we built using Wordpress just to push out an MVP.

            I signed a contract at CapaCiTi. Seemingly, all my efforts paid off
            and I got an internship for the first interview I've ever been on.
            The beginning of promising things, I even became web development
            team lead in the first half of the internship as we were building a
            website for a school that is digitizing.

            This period of my life was heavily inspired a book I hold very near
            and dear to my heart...Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python
            Features. It laid some of the foundations that started me on my
            journey to learning Django, especially the section on Classes &
            Object Oriented Programming. I also wish someone told me to have a
            stronghold on version control and that building projects was the
            best way to learn programming. Again, lessons learned... Also, with
            the discovery that I can be compensated for my writing code, I put
            in even more effort to learn about the industry as a whole. I
            contemplated being a freelance developer, a YouTuber, or an
            employee. Since I didn't know much, I vied for freelance because of
            the flexible schedule it offered. Not to be though...

            There are layers to this thing. Data structures and algorithms have
            made me a better programmer and abstract as they are, they have made
            me enjoy programminng a lot more because I had a look under the
            hood. The books which have been the most influential are How
            Computers Work: The Evolution of Technology, The Computer Book: From
            The Abacus to Artificial Intelligence, 250 Milestones in the History
            of Computer Science, Eloquent JavaScript and Computer Science
            Distilled. All I needed to feel comfortable with programming was
            solidified around this time.

            What has two thumbs and doesn't know what to study next after Python
            ? This guy! (referring to me) To be honest, learning JavaScript
            right after Python was a mistake. I still weep to this day. I should
            have asked for directions again. I thought I had figured it out. The
            truth is that in programming, especially in programming you are
            always figuring it out. All was not lost though, I course corrected
            and used a book called HTML and CSS: Build and Design websites by
            John Duckett. With lessons learned, I used another book by the same
            author called JavaScript & jQuery. Boom! Just like that front end
            web development on lock. Or so I thought...I still had to go through
            Mount React.

            My journey to relearn programming after a 10 year hiatus begins here
            with Python. I had asked for advice on coding forums and the advice
            I was given was that I should have a timeline. We live in a world of
            abundance and there was so much information to even start. But I
            dialled in into one course and one book. Less is more.
